Project Purpose
This project is related to designing and developing a hospital information system (HIS) that facilitates the management of operations within the hospital by centralizing information and improving communication between different departments, which contributes to raising the quality of healthcare and reducing routine administrative tasks, such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, and keeping medical records. The system is designed to be flexible and secure to ensure quick access to medical information and reduce human errors.

System Features
1. Patient Information Management
Patient Registration: The system allows employees to enter all patient data, such as personal information, health insurance, and medical history.
Medical Records Management: Enables doctors to update patients' medical files with data including diagnoses and prescribed treatments.
2. Appointment Management
Appointment Scheduling: Employees or patients can book appointments with doctors based on their available schedules, with the feature of sending automatic notifications and reminders to patients via email or SMS before appointments.
3. Billing and Payment
Creating invoices: The system automatically calculates costs based on the services provided, with the ability to track payment status.
Health Insurance Integration: Allows insurance claims to be sent automatically while ensuring that the patient is covered by insurance.
4. Reports and Analytics

Creating Reports: The system can generate customized reports on patient admissions, financial performance, and resource utilization.

Analytics Dashboard: Provides live data for management to track key performance indicators.

Target User Groups and Their Characteristics
The system serves different categories of users according to different levels of permissions and functions:

Doctors: They have full access to medical records, appointment schedules, and diagnostic tools.
Nursing staff: They can access medical care plans, appointments, and medication schedules.
Administrators: They can manage appointments, bills, and insurance claims.
Patients: They can access their medical history, appointments, and financial information through a secure portal.
Functional Requirements

1. Patient Registration and Medical Records Management
Patient Registration: Allows staff to enter patients’ personal data, medical history, and generate a unique identification number for each patient.
Record Update: Allows authorized users to update records by adding new diagnoses or laboratory results.
2. Appointment Scheduling
Doctor Availability: The system displays doctors’ schedules so that patients can book appointments that are convenient for them.
Appointment Notifications: Automatic reminders are sent to patients about their appointments.
3. Billing and Financial Transaction Management
Invoice Generation: The system generates an invoice for each patient based on the services provided during their visit.
Electronic Payment: It includes the option to pay bills electronically and track the payment status.
4. Reporting Tools
Reports: The system allows administrators to generate reports on financial data, doctors’ performance, and overall hospital performance.

Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance
The system should be able to handle at least 500 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
The system response time for critical operations such as retrieving medical records or scheduling appointments should not exceed 3 seconds.
2. Security
All patient data on the go should be encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols.
Sensitive data such as medical records should be stored securely using AES-256 encryption.
3. Scalability
The system should be scalable to support hospital growth and the integration of new features such as telemedicine or AI diagnostic tools.
4. Ease of Use
The system should provide a user-friendly interface with explanations and guides for staff to navigate and use.
System Usage Diagrams
Example: Patient Registration, which includes the flow of steps followed by the employee from entering the patient’s data to generating a unique identification number.
Example: Appointment Scheduling, which includes the steps of booking, confirming the appointment, and sending a notification to the patient.

Additional Considerations
1. Legal and Compliance Considerations
The system must comply with health data protection regulations such as HIPAA, to ensure the confidentiality and security of patient data.
2. Security Requirements
Frequent backups of critical data must be performed to ensure that it can be restored in the event of a failure.
The disaster recovery plan must be tested to ensure its effectiveness, including testing backups and data recovery.
3. Limitations
Bandwidth management must be considered to ensure that the overall performance of the system is not affected.
Remote support must be provided to resolve issues that are beyond the capabilities of the on-site IT team.
